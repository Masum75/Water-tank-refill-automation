I made a simple project to add in my learning automation,
an Automated Water Tank Refilling System using Siemens S7-1500 PLC in TIA Portal v18 and WinCC RT Advanced for SCADA & HMI visualization! ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:

The system automatically maintains the water level using three sensors:
âœ… Low-Level Sensor (<20%) â†’ Activates the pump to start refilling.
âœ… Medium-Level Sensor (20-90%) â†’ Monitors normal operation.
âœ… High-Level Sensor (>90%) â†’ Stops the pump and opens the drainage valve to prevent overflow.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

ðŸ”¹ When the low-level sensor detects low water, the pump starts to fill the tank.
ðŸ”¹ As the level reaches 90%, the high-level sensor activates, stopping the pump and opening the drainage valve to regulate water flow.
ðŸ”¹ The process repeats automatically, ensuring efficient water management without manual intervention.
